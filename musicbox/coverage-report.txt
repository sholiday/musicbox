Test coverage via cargo-tarpaulin (Rust 1.90.0, tarpaulin 0.33.0): 69.89% (130/186 lines covered). Remaining low spots: CLI startup paths in main.rs and audio backends behind feature flags. Next steps: add feature-flagged integration tests for Rodio/PCSC and consider exercising the Axum debug server via an async test. Remove this report after review.
